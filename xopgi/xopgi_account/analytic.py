'''Extends the Analytic Account model in several general ways.

Summary:

- Introduces a `temporarily_open` context manager that ensures analytic
  accounts to be open within the context manager.

# These extensions are not being used.  I think that if we reintroduce the

# modified, and this code would be useful again, although moved to the addon
# that creates the restriction.

        '''A context manager where all the accounts in the recordset are
        temporarily reopen if needed.

        Only closed accounts are reopen.  If no account is close, this is a
        no-op.

        If any account in the recordset is cancelled, raise a ValueError.
        Also the recordset must contain only accounts of type: 'normal' or
        'contract', otherwise raise a ValueError.

        The context manager yields the filtered recordset of closed accounts
        that were reopen.

        Usage::

            >>> with accounts.temporarily_open() as closed:
            ...    # Do something with 'accounts'...

        .. note:: No message tracking the temporary change is produced.
